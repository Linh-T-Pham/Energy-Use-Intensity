# Problem Setup 
Energy use intensity (EUI) is defined as energy per square foot per year. 
Itâ€™s calculated by dividing the total energy consumed by the building in one year (measured in kBtu) by the total gross floor area of the building. 
A low EUI indicates good energy performance.

This project will focus on the analysis of EUI in different San Francisco municipal facilities. 
EUI is the primary method of benchmarking the facilities.

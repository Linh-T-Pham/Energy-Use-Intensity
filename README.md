# Problem Setup 
Energy use intensity (EUI) is defined as energy per square foot per year. 
Itâ€™s calculated by dividing the total energy consumed by the building in one year (measured in kBtu) by the total gross floor area of the building. 
A low EUI indicates good energy performance.

This project will focus on the analysis of EUI in different San Francisco municipal facilities. 
EUI is the primary method of benchmarking the facilities. 

# Conclusions and Recommendations 
San Francisco should continue approaching to benchmarking the energy use of its portfolio of buildings. Benchmarking will help the city identify which building category tends to have higher EUI as well as which buildings are outliner among their peers. 

1.	The city should also renovate more old buildings in all categories because the building age has increased EUI significantly. 

2.	It is challenging to implement the process of energy benchmarking due to the difficulty and accuracy in data collection. However, with more effective effort to collect data, the better benchmarking reports will be produced going forward
